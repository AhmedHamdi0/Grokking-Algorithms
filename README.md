# Grokking-Algorithms
Embark on an algorithmic odyssey with the "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava.

# Chapters Notes
## 1. Introduction to algorithms:
    - Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.
    - Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.
    - O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster as the list of items you are srearching grows.
