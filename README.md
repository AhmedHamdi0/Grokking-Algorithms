# Grokking-Algorithms
Embark on an algorithmic odyssey with the "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Y. Bhargava.

## Chapters Notes
### 1. Introduction to algorithms:
    - Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.
    - Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.
    - O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster as the list of items you are srearching grows. 

### 2. Selection sort
    - With an array, elements are stored right next to each other. 
    - Arrays allow fast reads (random access).
    - With a linked list, elements are strewn all over, and one element stores the address of the next one. 
    - Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes.
